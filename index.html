        <h1>Every Business Needs a Digital Presence</h1>
        <p>A website is just the beginning.</p>
    </header>

    <section>
        <p>Your customers are online—searching, booking, paying, and connecting. That means your business needs more than just a website. You need a digital presence that works across the entire customer journey:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Showing up in search and on social media</li>
            <li>Accepting online payments and bookings</li>
            <li>Making a great first impression and staying in touch</li>
        </ul>

        <p>We help small businesses build a complete digital presence, from modern websites to social marketing, online bookings, and payment systems. No jargon. No bloated tech. Just the tools that actually help your business grow.</p>
